As of webpack 5, you can use [Web Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers) without [`worker-loader`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/worker-loader).

## Syntax

```js
new Worker(new URL('./worker.js', import.meta.url));
```

The syntax was chosen to allow running code without bundler since using this is available in native ECMAScript modules in the browser (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker/Worker). In webpack, the worker.js file that the `new Worker` API call refers to and the files that worker.js imports are additionally bundled.

## Example

**src/index.js**

```js
const worker = new Worker(new URL('./deep-thought.js', import.meta.url));
worker.postMessage({
  question:
    'The Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, The Universe, and Everything.',
});
worker.onmessage = ({ data: { answer } }) => {
  console.log(answer);
};
```

**src/deep-thought.js**

```js

import { getAnswer } from './answer';
self.onmessage = ({ data: { question } }) => {
  self.postMessage({
    answer: getAnswer(),
  });
};
```

**src/answer.js**

```js

export default function getAnswer() {
  return 42;
}
```

In this case, deep-thought.js and answer.js will be bundled for use in the web worker.

## Node.js

Similar syntax is supported in Node.js (>= 12.17.0):

```js
import { Worker } from 'worker_threads';

new Worker(new URL('./worker.js', import.meta.url));
```

Note that this is only available in ESM. `Worker` in CommonJS syntax is not supported by either webpack or Node.js.
